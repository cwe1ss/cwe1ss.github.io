Hello everyone!

Next week, I will attend the biggest German .NET conference [BASTA! Spring 2009](http://it-republik.de/dotnet/basta/). Feel free to contact me, if you’d like to chat with me "offline" there!

### What’s next on my blog?

I'm working on an ASP.Net MVC application right now and I plan to post about some of the techniques I've used, so expect to read from me after the conference!

Thanks for reading,  
Christian Weiss
